For a lack of a better imagination, the lynching of Aunt Jemmimah and Uncle Ben. <img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/5faa9559da7f9119a02024bf7fec32c0.webp\" />  I can't help but wonder, how do we so easily mistake symbolic victories for structural change? A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/390e9b84-b5c5-4070-9376-0763fe29c3a1.webp\" />  and invest *militantly* in our communities.

                "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/giphy.webp\" />\nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

                "content": "Let me be real with you - while 30% of patients generally find an SSRI efficacious, I've witnessed countless people struggle through nothing but disappointing if not flat-out failures of an experience with these medications.\n\nAs the love child of not one but two therapists, it should go without saying that I’m basically a certified LCSW in my own right…right?! Naturally it twas written in the stars that I’d fall in love with the field of Mental Health…and Psychology…and Neurochemistry. In other words, I’m not *completely* talking out of my ass!! I've devoured countless research papers over the years - we're talking around 100 in the last year alone.\n\nY’anyways, why the fuck is the cringe titular what it is? Well you see, I’m a bit of a nutcase myself. - I'm intimately familiar with the dark side of mental health. Depression and I are old friends. I’ve run the full gauntlet of SSRIs and can say without a doubt, the best experience I had was feeling comfortably numb. \n\nThen there was that 1 time I went hard-in-the-paint in analyzing my own neurobiology along with my previous drug interactions. I concluded Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Abilify (Aripiprazole) was my golden ticket. These are both metaphorically and literally atypical. We're talking real outsider medications here - an anti-seizure drug moonlighting as an antidepressant, paired with what was then a revolutionary atypical antipsychotic. So what happened? I happened. Whoops! I thought I was okay enough and I was pursuing a career in which I couldn’t be a sad sack of shit. Spoiler Alert: I was dead wrong. \n\nOn paper, I was crushing it – grinding through 8-hour workdays, logging flight hours, creating music, the whole nine yards. But underneath? That's another story. Then COVID hit, and everything went full-on FUBAR. The next six months? Pure chaos. Naturally what I’d been on just hadn’t been enough in my mind, so my PDoc and I explored other avenues. The next few years were a pharmaceutical merry-go-round - Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Wellbutrin – all fell short. Then came the plot twist: my therapist-for-a-Mommy connected me with a colleague who opened my eyes to psychiatry's rebellious underbelly – I felt at home.\n\nNow, I may be putting my own spin on this, but so what? S U E me! <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/6e61014e-5470-49e3-95e8-48fa723cc8ae.webp\" /> Here's the real kicker: we've gone down the rabbit hole of over-categorizing mental health, creating endless subcategories of subcategories until we can't see the forest for the trees. Instead of addressing the core issue - mood disorders - we're obsessing over hyper-specific conditions, niche enough only exist in the DSM-69. And guess what happens when you get lost in the diagnostic weeds? You completely miss the plot. Here's the real truth bomb: the issue isn’t so much that you are too blue or too anxious or whatever you might be, it is the dysregulation of emotions. Maybe you feel sad when you should feel angry. Maybe you feel angry when you should feel happy. The reality? You're not just 'too much' of any one thing - your emotional dial is just stuck on certain frequencies more often than others. Modern Psychiatry often misses the big picture. After all, are the problems and gut-wrenching details of your life you pour out in therapy not a big deal? Mmm, most likely these aren’t your own personal shortcomings – we just live in this post-industrial cesspool that propagate these problems. You don’t need to change as much as our society, our “culture” (or lack thereof) needs to. Instead, you just need to learn to live with ‘em; more-often-than-not we all must just cope with our issues.\n\nLamenting had become my default and I was all but ready to acquiesce in my comfortably numb place. Fast forward one year on Lithium and I’ve basically gotten my life back on track. O had to crawl, walk and learn how to run again. My most notable side effect, (plot twist: thanks Vraylar….whoops)? I’ve become a human sprinkler system. Any damn show I watch, whether it be the triumphant moments of *The Curious Case of Natalia Grace* or the saddest moments of *American Primeval* I’ve found myself absolutely bawling on a whim. But otherwise, I feel even-keeled, so of course I can take some cinematic cries. It’s better than your pecker not working or the anhedonia one normally experiences with/without SSRIs. \n\nLook, I won't pretend to have all the answers to our collective mental health crisis. How could I when our society seems perfectly engineered to create these modern “tragedies of the common.” We cannot go on like this and expect a different outcome. I will say that I don’t think we need a miracle; we just need to buy some time because we’re at a crossroads. With AI advancements, new forms of communities, and people finally realizing they need to get their shit together before helping others (goodbye abusers, alcoholics or otherwise unhinged peoples), there's hope. And hey, while we're waiting for the future to arrive, there's always that time-tested remedy: exercise. So get out there and exorcise those demons, you beautiful disasters.",

A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids  <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/1b65df65-e73b-4622-8e06-e45096c1e238.webp\" />and invest *militantly* in our communities.

                "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/257bd37c-578a-4291-a682-7015d76f37ba.webp\" /> \nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

                "content": "Let me be real with you - while 30% of patients generally find an SSRI efficacious, I've witnessed countless people struggle through nothing but disappointing if not flat-out failures of an experience with these medications.\n\nAs the love child of not one but two therapists, it should go without saying that I’m basically a certified LCSW in my own right…right?! Naturally it twas written in the stars that I’d fall in love with the field of Mental Health…and Psychology…and Neurochemistry. In other words, I’m not *completely* talking out of my ass!! I've devoured countless research papers over the years - we're talking around 100 in the last year alone.\n\nY’anyways, why the fuck is the cringe titular what it is? Well you see, I’m a bit of a nutcase myself. - I'm intimately familiar with the dark side of mental health. Depression and I are old friends. I’ve run the full gauntlet of SSRIs and can say without a doubt, the best experience I had was feeling comfortably numb. \n\nThen there was that 1 time I went hard-in-the-paint in analyzing my own neurobiology along with my previous drug interactions. I concluded Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Abilify (Aripiprazole) was my golden ticket. These are both metaphorically and literally atypical. We're talking real outsider medications here - an anti-seizure drug moonlighting as an antidepressant, paired with what was then a revolutionary atypical antipsychotic. So what happened? I happened. Whoops! I thought I was okay enough and I was pursuing a career in which I couldn’t be a sad sack of shit. Spoiler Alert: I was dead wrong. \n\nOn paper, I was crushing it – grinding through 8-hour workdays, logging flight hours, creating music, the whole nine yards. But underneath? That's another story. Then COVID hit, and everything went full-on FUBAR. The next six months? Pure chaos. Naturally what I’d been on just hadn’t been enough in my mind, so my PDoc and I explored other avenues. The next few years were a pharmaceutical merry-go-round - Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Wellbutrin – all fell short. Then came the plot twist: my therapist-for-a-Mommy connected me with a colleague who opened my eyes to psychiatry's rebellious underbelly – I felt at home.\n\nNow, I may be putting my own spin on this, but so what? S U E me!  <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/ae80d67c-827d-483c-a7ac-c13e0907b851.webp\" /> \nHere's the real kicker: we've gone down the rabbit hole of over-categorizing mental health, creating endless subcategories of subcategories until we can't see the forest for the trees. Instead of addressing the core issue - mood disorders - we're obsessing over hyper-specific conditions, niche enough only exist in the DSM-69. And guess what happens when you get lost in the diagnostic weeds? You completely miss the plot. Here's the real truth bomb: the issue isn’t so much that you are too blue or too anxious or whatever you might be, it is the dysregulation of emotions. Maybe you feel sad when you should feel angry. Maybe you feel angry when you should feel happy. The reality? You're not just 'too much' of any one thing - your emotional dial is just stuck on certain frequencies more often than others. Modern Psychiatry often misses the big picture. After all, are the problems and gut-wrenching details of your life you pour out in therapy not a big deal? Mmm, most likely these aren’t your own personal shortcomings – we just live in this post-industrial cesspool that propagate these problems. You don’t need to change as much as our society, our “culture” (or lack thereof) needs to. Instead, you just need to learn to live with ‘em; more-often-than-not we all must just cope with our issues.\n\nLamenting had become my default and I was all but ready to acquiesce in my comfortably numb place. Fast forward one year on Lithium and I’ve basically gotten my life back on track. O had to crawl, walk and learn how to run again. My most notable side effect, (plot twist: thanks Vraylar….whoops)? I’ve become a human sprinkler system. Any damn show I watch, whether it be the triumphant moments of *The Curious Case of Natalia Grace* or the saddest moments of *American Primeval* I’ve found myself absolutely bawling on a whim. But otherwise, I feel even-keeled, so of course I can take some cinematic cries. It’s better than your pecker not working or the anhedonia one normally experiences with/without SSRIs. \n\nLook, I won't pretend to have all the answers to our collective mental health crisis. How could I when our society seems perfectly engineered to create these modern “tragedies of the common.” We cannot go on like this and expect a different outcome. I will say that I don’t think we need a miracle; we just need to buy some time because we’re at a crossroads. With AI advancements, new forms of communities, and people finally realizing they need to get their shit together before helping others (goodbye abusers, alcoholics or otherwise unhinged peoples), there's hope. And hey, while we're waiting for the future to arrive, there's always that time-tested remedy: exercise. So get out there and exorcise those demons, you beautiful disasters.",

Fortunately, I do not think that the kneejerk anger and conceit will continue in perpetuity. Everyone has and will always want the same thing. To leave a legacy and love their family in peace. Every time you get caught up in vitriol and cultish worship of your “team,” you’re forgetting this. You’re letting “them” win. It’s the 1 platitude of Communism’s many that I wholly prescribe to – the working class is pitted against itself to distract workers from the rich accumulating obscene, inequitable amounts of wealth. The oligarchic, kleptocratic corporatocracy is the proper “them.”\n\nWhile we argue, attack and kill one another for whatever new issue enters the news cycle, the rich getting richer is the only constant. I’m not interested in these social and racial traps that the rats have set for us. Instead, I’m interested in the progress we are making in science & technology and the implications to our health, well-being and future. What will we do when AI has replaced many of our jobs? What happens when a majority of cancer has been eradicated? What significance will art & music continue to hold when AI is capable of mimicking every minute detail? We’re passionate about the existential issues that face our society. \n\nSo this website and its articles are dedicated to exploring these issues and, maybe, helping a few people out along the way. It’s Consumer Reports and New York Times meets Autism. We’re here to give you the lowdown on new things you’ll wish you’d have known of sooner and information on what you didn’t know you were in need of. \n\nI used cryptic “themes” to categorize articles, so, without further ado:\n - Awareness – Science & Technology\n - Control – Health, Fitness & Supplements\n - Escape – Travel\n - Soul – Philosophy, Self-Help\n - Present – Current Events",

For a lack of a better imagination, the lynching of Aunt Jemmimah and Uncle Ben. <img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/5faa9559da7f9119a02024bf7fec32c0.webp\" />  I can't help but wonder, how do we so easily mistake symbolic victories for structural change? A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/390e9b84-b5c5-4070-9376-0763fe29c3a1.webp\" />  and invest *militantly* in our communities.

                "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/giphy.webp\" />\nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

Naturally it twas written in the stars that I’d fall in love with the field of Mental Health…and Psychology…and Neurochemistry. In other words, I’m not *completely* talking out of my ass!! I've devoured countless research papers over the years - we're talking around 100 in the last year alone.\n\nY’anyways, why the fuck is the cringe titular what it is? Well you see, I’m a bit of a nutcase myself. - I'm intimately familiar with the dark side of mental health. Depression and I are old friends. I’ve run the full gauntlet of SSRIs and can say without a doubt, the best experience I had was feeling comfortably numb. \n\nThen there was that 1 time I went hard-in-the-paint in analyzing my own neurobiology along with my previous drug interactions. I concluded Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Abilify (Aripiprazole) was my golden ticket. These are both metaphorically and literally atypical. We're talking real outsider medications here - an anti-seizure drug moonlighting as an antidepressant, paired with what was then a revolutionary atypical antipsychotic. So what happened? I happened. Whoops! I thought I was okay enough and I was pursuing a career in which I couldn’t be a sad sack of shit. Spoiler Alert: I was dead wrong. \n\nOn paper, I was crushing it – grinding through 8-hour workdays, logging flight hours, creating music, the whole nine yards. But underneath? That's another story. Then COVID hit, and everything went full-on FUBAR. The next six months? Pure chaos. Naturally what I’d been on just hadn’t been enough in my mind, so my PDoc and I explored other avenues. The next few years were a pharmaceutical merry-go-round - Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Wellbutrin – all fell short. Then came the plot twist: my therapist-for-a-Mommy connected me with a colleague who opened my eyes to psychiatry's rebellious underbelly – I felt at home.\n\nNow, I may be putting my own spin on this, but so what? S U E me! <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/6e61014e-5470-49e3-95e8-48fa723cc8ae.webp\" /> Here's the real kicker: we've gone down the rabbit hole of over-categorizing mental health, creating endless subcategories of subcategories until we can't see the forest for the trees. Instead of addressing the core issue - mood disorders - we're obsessing over hyper-specific conditions, niche enough only exist in the DSM-69. And guess what happens when you get lost in the diagnostic weeds? You completely miss the plot. Here's the real truth bomb: the issue isn’t so much that you are too blue or too anxious or whatever you might be, it is the dysregulation of emotions. Maybe you feel sad when you should feel angry. Maybe you feel angry when you should feel happy. The reality? You're not just 'too much' of any one thing - your emotional dial is just stuck on certain frequencies more often than others. Modern Psychiatry often misses the big picture. After all, are the problems and gut-wrenching details of your life you pour out in therapy not a big deal? Mmm, most likely these aren’t your own personal shortcomings – we just live in this post-industrial cesspool that propagate these problems. You don’t need to change as much as our society, our “culture” (or lack thereof) needs to. Instead, you just need to learn to live with ‘em; more-often-than-not we all must just cope with our issues.\n\nLamenting had become my default and I was all but ready to acquiesce in my comfortably numb place. Fast forward one year on Lithium and I’ve basically gotten my life back on track. O had to crawl, walk and learn how to run again. My most notable side effect, (plot twist: thanks Vraylar….whoops)? I’ve become a human sprinkler system. Any damn show I watch, whether it be the triumphant moments of *The Curious Case of Natalia Grace* or the saddest moments of *American Primeval* I’ve found myself absolutely bawling on a whim. But otherwise, I feel even-keeled, so of course I can take some cinematic cries. It’s better than your pecker not working or the anhedonia one normally experiences with/without SSRIs. \n\nLook, I won't pretend to have all the answers to our collective mental health crisis. How could I when our society seems perfectly engineered to create these modern “tragedies of the common.” We cannot go on like this and expect a different outcome. I will say that I don’t think we need a miracle; we just need to buy some time because we’re at a crossroads. With AI advancements, new forms of communities, and people finally realizing they need to get their shit together before helping others (goodbye abusers, alcoholics or otherwise unhinged peoples), there's hope. And hey, while we're waiting for the future to arrive, there's always that time-tested remedy: exercise. So get out there and exorcise those demons, you beautiful disasters.",

For a lack of a better imagination, the lynching of Aunt Jemmimah and Uncle Ben. <img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/5faa9559da7f9119a02024bf7fec32c0.webp\" />  I can't help but wonder, how do we so easily mistake symbolic victories for structural change? A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/390e9b84-b5c5-4070-9376-0763fe29c3a1.webp\" />  and invest *militantly* in our communities.

                "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/giphy.webp\" />\nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

Naturally it twas written in the stars that I’d fall in love with the field of Mental Health…and Psychology…and Neurochemistry. In other words, I’m not *completely* talking out of my ass!! I've devoured countless research papers over the years - we're talking around 100 in the last year alone.\n\nY’anyways, why the fuck is the cringe titular what it is? Well you see, I’m a bit of a nutcase myself. - I'm intimately familiar with the dark side of mental health. Depression and I are old friends. I’ve run the full gauntlet of SSRIs and can say without a doubt, the best experience I had was feeling comfortably numb. \n\nThen there was that 1 time I went hard-in-the-paint in analyzing my own neurobiology along with my previous drug interactions. I concluded Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Abilify (Aripiprazole) was my golden ticket. These are both metaphorically and literally atypical. We're talking real outsider medications here - an anti-seizure drug moonlighting as an antidepressant, paired with what was then a revolutionary atypical antipsychotic. So what happened? I happened. Whoops! I thought I was okay enough and I was pursuing a career in which I couldn’t be a sad sack of shit. Spoiler Alert: I was dead wrong. \n\nOn paper, I was crushing it – grinding through 8-hour workdays, logging flight hours, creating music, the whole nine yards. But underneath? That's another story. Then COVID hit, and everything went full-on FUBAR. The next six months? Pure chaos. Naturally what I’d been on just hadn’t been enough in my mind, so my PDoc and I explored other avenues. The next few years were a pharmaceutical merry-go-round - Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Wellbutrin – all fell short. Then came the plot twist: my therapist-for-a-Mommy connected me with a colleague who opened my eyes to psychiatry's rebellious underbelly – I felt at home.\n\nNow, I may be putting my own spin on this, but so what? S U E me! <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/6e61014e-5470-49e3-95e8-48fa723cc8ae.webp\" /> Here's the real kicker: we've gone down the rabbit hole of over-categorizing mental health, creating endless subcategories of subcategories until we can't see the forest for the trees. Instead of addressing the core issue - mood disorders - we're obsessing over hyper-specific conditions, niche enough only exist in the DSM-69. And guess what happens when you get lost in the diagnostic weeds? You completely miss the plot. Here's the real truth bomb: the issue isn’t so much that you are too blue or too anxious or whatever you might be, it is the dysregulation of emotions. Maybe you feel sad when you should feel angry. Maybe you feel angry when you should feel happy. The reality? You're not just 'too much' of any one thing - your emotional dial is just stuck on certain frequencies more often than others. Modern Psychiatry often misses the big picture. After all, are the problems and gut-wrenching details of your life you pour out in therapy not a big deal? Mmm, most likely these aren’t your own personal shortcomings – we just live in this post-industrial cesspool that propagate these problems. You don’t need to change as much as our society, our “culture” (or lack thereof) needs to. Instead, you just need to learn to live with ‘em; more-often-than-not we all must just cope with our issues.\n\nLamenting had become my default and I was all but ready to acquiesce in my comfortably numb place. Fast forward one year on Lithium and I’ve basically gotten my life back on track. O had to crawl, walk and learn how to run again. My most notable side effect, (plot twist: thanks Vraylar….whoops)? I’ve become a human sprinkler system. Any damn show I watch, whether it be the triumphant moments of *The Curious Case of Natalia Grace* or the saddest moments of *American Primeval* I’ve found myself absolutely bawling on a whim. But otherwise, I feel even-keeled, so of course I can take some cinematic cries. It’s better than your pecker not working or the anhedonia one normally experiences with/without SSRIs. \n\nLook, I won't pretend to have all the answers to our collective mental health crisis. How could I when our society seems perfectly engineered to create these modern “tragedies of the common.” We cannot go on like this and expect a different outcome. I will say that I don’t think we need a miracle; we just need to buy some time because we’re at a crossroads. With AI advancements, new forms of communities, and people finally realizing they need to get their shit together before helping others (goodbye abusers, alcoholics or otherwise unhinged peoples), there's hope. And hey, while we're waiting for the future to arrive, there's always that time-tested remedy: exercise. So get out there and exorcise those demons, you beautiful disasters.",

For a lack of a better imagination, the lynching of Aunt Jemmimah and Uncle Ben. <img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/5faa9559da7f9119a02024bf7fec32c0.webp\" />  I can't help but wonder, how do we so easily mistake symbolic victories for structural change? A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/390e9b84-b5c5-4070-9376-0763fe29c3a1.webp\" />  and invest *militantly* in our communities.

                "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/giphy.webp\" />\nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

                "content": "Let me be real with you - while 30% of patients generally find an SSRI efficacious, I've witnessed countless people struggle through nothing but disappointing if not flat-out failures of an experience with these medications.\n\nAs the love child of not one but two therapists, it should go without saying that I’m basically a certified LCSW in my own right…right?! Naturally it twas written in the stars that I’d fall in love with the field of Mental Health…and Psychology…and Neurochemistry. In other words, I’m not *completely* talking out of my ass!! I've devoured countless research papers over the years - we're talking around 100 in the last year alone.\n\nY’anyways, why the fuck is the cringe titular what it is? Well you see, I’m a bit of a nutcase myself. - I'm intimately familiar with the dark side of mental health. Depression and I are old friends. I’ve run the full gauntlet of SSRIs and can say without a doubt, the best experience I had was feeling comfortably numb. \n\nThen there was that 1 time I went hard-in-the-paint in analyzing my own neurobiology along with my previous drug interactions. I concluded Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Abilify (Aripiprazole) was my golden ticket. These are both metaphorically and literally atypical. We're talking real outsider medications here - an anti-seizure drug moonlighting as an antidepressant, paired with what was then a revolutionary atypical antipsychotic. So what happened? I happened. Whoops! I thought I was okay enough and I was pursuing a career in which I couldn’t be a sad sack of shit. Spoiler Alert: I was dead wrong. \n\nOn paper, I was crushing it – grinding through 8-hour workdays, logging flight hours, creating music, the whole nine yards. But underneath? That's another story. Then COVID hit, and everything went full-on FUBAR. The next six months? Pure chaos. Naturally what I’d been on just hadn’t been enough in my mind, so my PDoc and I explored other avenues. The next few years were a pharmaceutical merry-go-round - Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Wellbutrin – all fell short. Then came the plot twist: my therapist-for-a-Mommy connected me with a colleague who opened my eyes to psychiatry's rebellious underbelly – I felt at home.\n\nNow, I may be putting my own spin on this, but so what? S U E me! <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/6e61014e-5470-49e3-95e8-48fa723cc8ae.webp\" /> Here's the real kicker: we've gone down the rabbit hole of over-categorizing mental health, creating endless subcategories of subcategories until we can't see the forest for the trees. Instead of addressing the core issue - mood disorders - we're obsessing over hyper-specific conditions, niche enough only exist in the DSM-69. And guess what happens when you get lost in the diagnostic weeds? You completely miss the plot. Here's the real truth bomb: the issue isn’t so much that you are too blue or too anxious or whatever you might be, it is the dysregulation of emotions. Maybe you feel sad when you should feel angry. Maybe you feel angry when you should feel happy. The reality? You're not just 'too much' of any one thing - your emotional dial is just stuck on certain frequencies more often than others. Modern Psychiatry often misses the big picture. After all, are the problems and gut-wrenching details of your life you pour out in therapy not a big deal? Mmm, most likely these aren’t your own personal shortcomings – we just live in this post-industrial cesspool that propagate these problems. You don’t need to change as much as our society, our “culture” (or lack thereof) needs to. Instead, you just need to learn to live with ‘em; more-often-than-not we all must just cope with our issues.\n\nLamenting had become my default and I was all but ready to acquiesce in my comfortably numb place. Fast forward one year on Lithium and I’ve basically gotten my life back on track. O had to crawl, walk and learn how to run again. My most notable side effect, (plot twist: thanks Vraylar….whoops)? I’ve become a human sprinkler system. Any damn show I watch, whether it be the triumphant moments of *The Curious Case of Natalia Grace* or the saddest moments of *American Primeval* I’ve found myself absolutely bawling on a whim. But otherwise, I feel even-keeled, so of course I can take some cinematic cries. It’s better than your pecker not working or the anhedonia one normally experiences with/without SSRIs. \n\nLook, I won't pretend to have all the answers to our collective mental health crisis. How could I when our society seems perfectly engineered to create these modern “tragedies of the common.” We cannot go on like this and expect a different outcome. I will say that I don’t think we need a miracle; we just need to buy some time because we’re at a crossroads. With AI advancements, new forms of communities, and people finally realizing they need to get their shit together before helping others (goodbye abusers, alcoholics or otherwise unhinged peoples), there's hope. And hey, while we're waiting for the future to arrive, there's always that time-tested remedy: exercise. So get out there and exorcise those demons, you beautiful disasters.",

            "post": "We live in a contentious and highly polarized society today. It’s full of hate and ignorance in spite of us living through the Age of Information. Fortunately, I do not think that the kneejerk anger and conceit will continue forever. Everyone has and will always want the same thing. To leave a legacy and love their family in peace. Every time you get caught up in vitriol and cultish worship of your “team,” you’re forgetting this. You’re letting “them” win. It’s the 1 platitude of Communism’s many that I wholly prescribe to – the working class is pitted against itself to distract workers from the rich accumulating obscene, inequitable wealth. The oligarchic, kleptocratic corporatocracy is the proper “them.”\n\nWhile we argue, attack and kill one another for whatever new issue enters the news cycle, the rich getting richer is the only constant. I’m not interested in these social and racial traps that the rats have set for us. Instead, I’m interested in the progress we are making in science & technology and the implications to our health, well-being and future. What will we do when AI has replaced many of our jobs? What will we do when a majority of cancer has been eradicated? What significance will art & music continue to hold when AI is capable of mimicking every minute detail? I’m passionate about the existential issues that face our society. \n\nSo this website and its articles are dedicated to exploring these issues and, maybe, helping a few people out along the way. It’s Consumer Reports and New York Times meets Autism. I don’t want to talk about what everyone else is talking about because why bother listening to our featured authors and myself on those issues? We’re here to give you the lowdown on new things you’ll wish you’d have known of sooner and information on what you didn’t know you were in need of. ",

For a lack of a better imagination, the lynching of Aunt Jemmimah and Uncle Ben. <img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/5faa9559da7f9119a02024bf7fec32c0.webp\" />  I can't help but wonder, how do we so easily mistake symbolic victories for structural change? A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/390e9b84-b5c5-4070-9376-0763fe29c3a1.webp\" />  and invest *militantly* in our communities.

                "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img align=”right” src=\"./attachment/giphy.webp\" />\nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

Naturally it twas written in the stars that I’d fall in love with the field of Mental Health…and Psychology…and Neurochemistry. In other words, I’m not *completely* talking out of my ass!! I've devoured countless research papers over the years - we're talking around 100 in the last year alone.\n\nY’anyways, why the fuck is the cringe titular what it is? Well you see, I’m a bit of a nutcase myself. - I'm intimately familiar with the dark side of mental health. Depression and I are old friends. I’ve run the full gauntlet of SSRIs and can say without a doubt, the best experience I had was feeling comfortably numb. \n\nThen there was that 1 time I went hard-in-the-paint in analyzing my own neurobiology along with my previous drug interactions. I concluded Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and Abilify (Aripiprazole) was my golden ticket. These are both metaphorically and literally atypical. We're talking real outsider medications here - an anti-seizure drug moonlighting as an antidepressant, paired with what was then a revolutionary atypical antipsychotic. So what happened? I happened. Whoops! I thought I was okay enough and I was pursuing a career in which I couldn’t be a sad sack of shit. Spoiler Alert: I was dead wrong. \n\nOn paper, I was crushing it – grinding through 8-hour workdays, logging flight hours, creating music, the whole nine yards. But underneath? That's another story. Then COVID hit, and everything went full-on FUBAR. The next six months? Pure chaos. Naturally what I’d been on just hadn’t been enough in my mind, so my PDoc and I explored other avenues. The next few years were a pharmaceutical merry-go-round - Fluoxetine, Duloxetine, Wellbutrin – all fell short. Then came the plot twist: my therapist-for-a-Mommy connected me with a colleague who opened my eyes to psychiatry's rebellious underbelly – I felt at home.\n\nNow, I may be putting my own spin on this, but so what? S U E me! <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/6e61014e-5470-49e3-95e8-48fa723cc8ae.webp\" /> Here's the real kicker: we've gone down the rabbit hole of over-categorizing mental health, creating endless subcategories of subcategories until we can't see the forest for the trees. Instead of addressing the core issue - mood disorders - we're obsessing over hyper-specific conditions, niche enough only exist in the DSM-69. And guess what happens when you get lost in the diagnostic weeds? You completely miss the plot. Here's the real truth bomb: the issue isn’t so much that you are too blue or too anxious or whatever you might be, it is the dysregulation of emotions. Maybe you feel sad when you should feel angry. Maybe you feel angry when you should feel happy. The reality? You're not just 'too much' of any one thing - your emotional dial is just stuck on certain frequencies more often than others. Modern Psychiatry often misses the big picture. After all, are the problems and gut-wrenching details of your life you pour out in therapy not a big deal? Mmm, most likely these aren’t your own personal shortcomings – we just live in this post-industrial cesspool that propagate these problems. You don’t need to change as much as our society, our “culture” (or lack thereof) needs to. Instead, you just need to learn to live with ‘em; more-often-than-not we all must just cope with our issues.\n\nLamenting had become my default and I was all but ready to acquiesce in my comfortably numb place. Fast forward one year on Lithium and I’ve basically gotten my life back on track. O had to crawl, walk and learn how to run again. My most notable side effect, (plot twist: thanks Vraylar….whoops)? I’ve become a human sprinkler system. Any damn show I watch, whether it be the triumphant moments of *The Curious Case of Natalia Grace* or the saddest moments of *American Primeval* I’ve found myself absolutely bawling on a whim. But otherwise, I feel even-keeled, so of course I can take some cinematic cries. It’s better than your pecker not working or the anhedonia one normally experiences with/without SSRIs. \n\nLook, I won't pretend to have all the answers to our collective mental health crisis. How could I when our society seems perfectly engineered to create these modern “tragedies of the common.” We cannot go on like this and expect a different outcome. I will say that I don’t think we need a miracle; we just need to buy some time because we’re at a crossroads. With AI advancements, new forms of communities, and people finally realizing they need to get their shit together before helping others (goodbye abusers, alcoholics or otherwise unhinged peoples), there's hope. And hey, while we're waiting for the future to arrive, there's always that time-tested remedy: exercise. So get out there and exorcise those demons, you beautiful disasters.",

            "content": "What did we get out of BLM Protests? For a lack of a better imagination, the lynching of Aunt Jemmimah and Uncle Ben. <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/8aace46d-35a0-4897-b603-75778a1965e1.webp\" />  I can't help but wonder, how do we so easily mistake symbolic victories for structural change? A few police departments were stripped bare of their funding ( because…I guess changing the part of training to beat the black out of your perp was just too hard to revise? Err, to not shoot Philando Castille in front of his wife and small child for reaching for the permit that proved he had a lawful right to carry. Apparently we’re all on PCP because tasers don’t work???)  But on the real, the darkest era ended thanks to BLM (I swear, no pun intended) with the fundamental destruction of the Dixie Chicks, left only to be known as “the Chicks”, who? I can’t wait until that becomes unconscionable and they become “the” (©hick is a derogatory term, you heard it here first, folks, ‘member that )\n\nAnd thank god the powers that be took down the outrageous and deeply hateful Advanced Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community. We did it Reddit!\n\nLook, I’m not here to belittle a movement that I see as having significance that’s far from theoretical; I just believe BLM lacks the same accountability that is so desperately needed out of our police force. The ironic part is that there is a semblance of a face of authority when it comes to the police…yet there’s still 0 accountability. Oh yeah, unless you’re Derek Chauvin. In some regards, he got a raw deal. On one hand, police should have never been involved with something as petty as a counterfeit $20 dollar bill, on the other, the fact that George Floyd had Fentanyl in his system brings up a dilemma wherein Floyd wouldn’t have died from the asphyxiation. In my opinion, the police state has blood on its hands and its just ill-advised to shoot the messenger (or the harbinger, in this case). We have police budgets that are out-of-control and a modus operandi that is simply perverse when you consider “To Serve and Protect.” Bringing Derek Chauvin to “justice” does not resolve these issues, it is not a win in my book. \n\nIf we need it – and we so desperately do, we should get the Federal Government to force the hand of our 50 states into delineating from the militarization of the police force into peace-keeping officers. Guns should be the last resort – but they should absolutely be an option in our gun lovin’ society. Don’t let the media fool you – most interactions with police end…amicably. In retrospect, these infamous murders were spotlighted for political gain, which is tragic. I’d be shocked to learn that the number of murders by police has fallen significantly since 2020, we just don’t hear about it, so we don’t think about it. It’s still ostensibly high but that is proof that the work is far from over.\n\nI believe that little to no work will be done until/if it becomes a hot button issue in the rapid-fire news cycle. So back to the original point at hand – what should be done? Well, I believe we need to look back in history and embrace the ‘60’s and ‘70’s eras’ palpable Civil Rights Movements. We had leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton who didn’t just move the needle, they moved mountains. We need charismatic, larger-than-life leaders who the hackneyed government mouthpieces can interface with; this is how you ensure accountability and see results. Movements need faces, not hashtags. Today, we're trying to fight a system with memes and viral tweets - it's like bringing a TikTok dance to a chess match.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this faceless, amorphous style of Social Justice does not work. Think I’m wrong? [^1] [^2] [^3] These purportedly “Communist” leaders hoodwinked many good-natured donors out of their hard-earned money. Of course, this is an endemic issue that poisons innumerable NFOs but we’re here to discuss BLM. We deserve better than this and we’ve had better. The other issue with BLM-type organizations is that they are by design decentralized and different. Every city has their own flavour of BLM as a result. But I abscond from the notion that this is good. To make waves in an ocean you need a commotion of epic proportions and that’s a matter of reducing the quotient. The only…and yes this is a big ‘un…negative of a monolithic structure is it lives and dies by the brain, the heart of the movement. Look, I generally favour decentralization and, uh, you probably noted that *every single Black Power Leader I named was assassinated*. So there’s that. However, the FBI is better today (*maybe tomorrow’s next brave leader will just be killed in a tragic plane crash, thanks CIA!*)!!! But, seriously, the silver lining of our dystopian surveillance state? It’s basically impossible to disappear someone in the modern era. There’s a Ring™ Doorbell on every door, a TikTok™ Live Streamer at every corner and an Amazon™ Prime™ Delivery™ happening just down the street™ (I’ve trademarked this, don’t use it or I’ll sue). Oh and not to forget that unwell classmate from High School who flooded the halls with a cat urine odor and picked his nose incessantly throughout 4th period now spends every waking moment disseminating a conspiracy theory on his Insta story whenever anything happens *ever*.  Nothing gets past our unsung hero.\n\nI guess that’s just the world we live in. But we can do better. We can abolish the CIA…for starters. Better yet, we can divest in Helicopters, SWAT Armored Vehicles ‘n Drug Raids  <img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/1b65df65-e73b-4622-8e06-e45096c1e238.webp\" />and invest *militantly* in our communities.

          "content": "Let's dive into an esoteric field full of landmines: the complex relationship between humans and exotic animals. I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh? You tell me!\n\nNow, there’s plenty of philosophical schools of thought on this (*dozens I tell you, dozens*)\n<img src=\"https://uywhaywnylcjrvkcsdem.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/article-images/257bd37c-578a-4291-a682-7015d76f37ba.webp\" /> \nWhere was I? At one extreme, we have the anti-pet purists, wielding their philosophical absolutism like a moral compass that only points toward total animal independence. Fortunately I ain’t one of those, no SJW-type preach-o-potamus platitudes to spit…*yet*. But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs! Prohibition often causes more harm than good - a truth that makes us uncomfortable but demands acknowledgment.\n\nMaybe its prudent to accept reality – that the human condition cannot be forbade and people will do the thing anyways. In such a case, we should simply have robust community support systems and regulatory government programs that curtail the worst offenders. Sometimes its okay to snitch, Karen. \n\nWith the negative out of the way, we can move on to the real tea. TL;DR lettuce not commodify exotic animals and we’ve opened Pandora’s Box when it comes to dogs, cats, rabbits and so on. We dun ducked up already and they need us as much as we need them, yay! In a world without strong communities and belongingness, our furry friends are oft our lifelines – emotional anchors in a storm of technological alienation. Our best defense against modern damnation, also known as the 1 AM 1 Train Jump…I mean, between SWIM (*someone who I met…plebeian, this is getting old*) and suicide. \n\nI think a doggo would prefer a handful of hours of sleep and laying around, considering they naturally sleep 10 to 14 hours of the damn day, than having to play Frogger to find scraps of food. But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for. But globally speaking, that’s probably 1 to 10% of captive animals. We keep ‘em safe and they live a nominally regular life. It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live. I keep those pictures under lock-and-key, I can’t even look at ‘em, I just cringe. Just because it is there doesn’t mean it always will be – it ain’t natural. \n\nEach liked video, each shared photo of a captive wild animal, creates ripples in an ecosystem of exploitation. Yet simply condemning these practices without acknowledging their deep psychological appeal misses crucial nuance. We're drawn to these creatures because they represent something wild and authentic in a world that feels increasingly artificial. The tragedy lies in how this yearning for connection often leads to further disconnection from nature's true essence. Don’t make the same mistake as yours truly. The End.",

I’m sure for plenty of y’all, it’s not something you think of everyday – or maybe ever. However it is expansive and it is a pervasive issue. I catch myself flicking through my TimTom Feed, thumb tentatively hovering over the like button of Pumba the Caracal or Медьведь Светланы (that's Svetlana's Bear, for you plebeians) videos, fighting the cognitive dissonance between their undeniable cuteness and the ethical nightmare they represent. Let's cut through the Instagram filter: exotic animals aren't meant to be social media props - they're meant to be wild, untamed, and free from our desperate need for likes and shares. That’s the bottomline.   \n\nTake Pumba - that contemptuous growl isn't just noise, it's a primal protest against domestication, a daily reminder that the shitty owner has crossed the line. The Bear who shall remain nameless?  This majestic creature…reduced to a living Instagram prop…cycles through endless photoshoots with weirdo ballerina whackos, wannabe influencers chasing clout or odd Russian couples yearning for that unique wedding shot to hang at their dacha. The irony of using a captive wild animal to symbolize freedom and romance is apparently lost on them. Svet claims the bear isn't sedated but I call shenanigi  (that’s plural for shenanigan, plebeian) - a declawed apex predator docilely posing with strangers? That's not natural; that's pharmaceutical compliance. If either isn’t a prop for digital validation, I’ll be damned, but you can’t tell me Pumba nor the Bear invigorate others’ decisions to purchase their very own clout machine. What kind of a Clout Machine Lifestyle is a life for a 2-ton hummer suffering from a lack of hot bear babe hummers, huh?

But there are people, beyond the PETA zealots, who believe dogs, cats and rats or whatever fits your hat don’t make the scratch. Personally, I love my dog and you can fuck off. Certainly there will be terrible situations, ones outside the purview of animal cruelty (e.g., dogs left to sleep and sit around all day, *maybe* getting a couple 5 minute strolls around the block), but I don’t think that should ruin it for the rest of us. It’s almost like…guns, hookers and drugs!

But maybe that’s just me. We just don’t need to get more critters in our crew, if you ask me. But there’s plenty of shitheads who will force a ‘Roo into captivity, heck, a tiger, just to flex on the ‘gram or to get their furry feathers fluffed and stuffed. Okay, admittedly the latter is a stretch, but that’s how we all should treat these furry fella fuckers like. \n\nThis is where things *finally* get interesting. What about zoo aminals and other spectacles? There are ethical ones for the endangered animals with proper roaming fields for all the grazing any Tasmanian Devil could dream for.

It is kinda like how we keep that weird furry kid who lives in his Mum’s basement comfortable! Unfortunately that’s nothing like the lives of caged Tiger attractions in Thailand or the Elephant Rides in Thailand or or…sorry Thailand, I’ll stop there. Sedated and constantly masturbated, these majestic creatures are subject to a grotesque parody of existence that strips away every shred of their regal dignity. Now this wouldn’t seem all too tumultuous of a topic but I swear to God every year I see another shmuck do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves that it’s not *that* unethical. I may have been one of those shmucks, whoops. YOLO amirite? Truthfully, I felt damning regret that overwhelmed me the second I stepped into the Tiger Tourist Trap, it’s no way for a Tiger to live.
