It’s full of hate and ignorance in spite of us living through the Age of Information. Fortunately, I do not think that the kneejerk anger and conceit will continue forever. Everyone has and will always want the same thing. To leave a legacy and love their family in peace. Every time you get caught up in vitriol and cultish worship of your “team,” you’re forgetting this. You’re letting “them” win. It’s the 1 platitude of Communism’s many that I wholly prescribe to – the working class is pitted against itself to distract workers from the rich accumulating obscene, inequitable wealth. The oligarchic, kleptocratic corporatocracy is the proper “them.”\n\nWhile we argue, attack and kill one another for whatever new issue enters the news cycle, the rich getting richer is the only constant. I’m not interested in these social and racial traps that the rats have set for us. Instead, I’m interested in the progress we are making in science & technology and the implications to our health, well-being and future. What will we do when AI has replaced many of our jobs? What will we do when a majority of cancer has been eradicated? What significance will art & music continue to hold when AI is capable of mimicking every minute detail? I’m passionate about the existential issues that face our society. \n\nSo this website and its articles are dedicated to exploring these issues and, maybe, helping a few people out along the way. It’s Consumer Reports and New York Times meets Autism. ~~I don’t want to talk about what everyone else is talking about because why bother listening to our featured authors and myself on those issues?~~ We’re here to give you the lowdown on new things you’ll wish you’d have known of sooner and information on what you didn’t know you were in need of. \n\nI used cryptic “themes” to categorize articles, so, without further ado:\n\t Awareness – Science & Technology\n\t Control – Health, Fitness & Supplements\n\t Escape – Travel\n\t Love – Philosophy, Self-Help\n\t Present – Current Events","imageUrl":"/translogo3000.png","author":"John Doe","date":"01.05.25","engagement":{"views":0,"likes":0,"comments":0},"imageAlt":"Penis","mainTitle":"Awareness","readTime":"5 Min Read"},"id":"ArticleDialog-98a3b2f6-4f16-489d-9e43-8b45c0c8c87e"}}],"DropColumn-6d8ba366-bb29-455e-84c8-163f821eeb52:zone-DropColumn-6d8ba366-bb29-455e-84c8-163f821eeb52-0":[{"type":"Ticker","props":{"items":[{"text":"Breaking News"},{"text":"Latest Updates"},{"text":"Featured Story"}],"direction":"left","speed":"medium","pauseOnHover":"true","theme":"light","id":"Ticker-2e953f9c-32d1-4f0d-ab15-ac0f0a70a5bc","sources":{"guardian":true,"foreignPolicy":true,"proPub":false},"guardianApiKey":"facb25af-200e-4c4c-828c-f6fb43d81e9f","maxArticlesPerSource":3}}],"DropColumn-6d8ba366-bb29-455e-84c8-163f821eeb52:zone-DropColumn-6d8ba366-bb29-455e-84c8-163f821eeb52-1":[{"type":"FeaturedHeader","props":{"title":"Featured Articles","linkText":"See All","linkUrl":"/articles","showDivider":true,"id":"FeaturedHeader-ad37507d-4fee-4b75-8cad-e933c8b7c1a9"}}],"DropColumn-6d8ba366-bb29-455e-84c8-163f821eeb52:zone-DropColumn-6d8ba366-bb29-455e-84c8-163f821eeb52-2":[{"type":"ArticleList","props":{"maxArticles":5,"showDivider":true,"articles":[{"id":"article-0","number":1,"title":"Article 1","date":"12.06.2021","summary":"Sample summary text","link":"/article/1","engagement":{"views":662,"likes":74,"comments":45,"showStats":true}},{"id":"article-1","number":2,"title":"Article 2","date":"12.06.2021","summary":"Sample summary text","link":"/article/2","engagement":{"views":296,"likes":68,"comments":39,"showStats":true}},{"id":"article-2","number":3,"title":"Article 3","date":"12.06.2021","summary":"Sample summary text","link":"/article/3","engagement":{"views":12,"likes":39,"comments":20,"showStats":true}},{"id":"article-3","number":4,"title":"Article 4","date":"12.06.2021","summary":"Sample summary text","link":"/article/4","engagement":{"views":916,"likes":0,"comments":46,"showStats":true}},{"id":"article-4","number":5,"title":"Article 5","date":"12.06.2021","summary":"Sample summary text","link":"/article/5","engagement":{"views":367,"likes":85,"comments":21,"showStats":true}}],"id":"ArticleList-53152855-1795-4939-9b4d-bdfce9260545"}}],"ArticleList-53152855-1795-4939-9b4d-bdfce9260545:my-content 1":[{"type":"Circle","props":{"title":"Leave Your Old Life Behind","subtitle":"Explore","blurb":"Don't try to be like someone else, be yourself.

It’s full of hate and ignorance in spite of us living through the Age of Information. Fortunately, I do not think that the kneejerk anger and conceit will continue forever. Everyone has and will always want the same thing. To leave a legacy and love their family in peace. Every time you get caught up in vitriol and cultish worship of your “team,” you’re forgetting this. You’re letting “them” win. It’s the 1 platitude of Communism’s many that I wholly prescribe to – the working class is pitted against itself to distract workers from the rich accumulating obscene, inequitable wealth. The oligarchic, kleptocratic corporatocracy is the proper “them.”\n\nWhile we argue, attack and kill one another for whatever new issue enters the news cycle, the rich getting richer is the only constant. I’m not interested in these social and racial traps that the rats have set for us. Instead, I’m interested in the progress we are making in science & technology and the implications to our health, well-being and future. What will we do when AI has replaced many of our jobs? What will we do when a majority of cancer has been eradicated? What significance will art & music continue to hold when AI is capable of mimicking every minute detail? I’m passionate about the existential issues that face our society. \n\nSo this website and its articles are dedicated to exploring these issues and, maybe, helping a few people out along the way. It’s Consumer Reports and New York Times meets Autism. I don’t want to talk about what everyone else is talking about because why bother listening to our featured authors and myself on those issues? We’re here to give you the lowdown on new things you’ll wish you’d have known of sooner and information on what you didn’t know you were in need of.

I tend to be unapologetically open so I’ll also mention my stint in Air Force ROTC. But 4 years went out the window, merely due to an unfounded marijuana allegation. My Dad has Parkinson’s, too. Point being? Turning tragedy into triumph. "},{"text":"Everything that’s happened is everything that I am. Even PD has had its fair share of influence upon me. I’m always researching the underlying pathology of PD and learning more about our biology (primarily Neurochemistry, but it is an unrelenting disease of the commons). It is likely fair to say that these events have influenced my beliefs. I strongly believe in a free and fair market when it comes to common products but would like to see the socialization and strong (yet smart) regulation of anything deemed necessary for the pursuit of Life, Liberty and Happiness in the modern era; this includes but is not limited to University, Healthcare and Internet. "},{"text":"My biggest beef is with the monopolies of the modern era, therein, Nvidia, Google, Facebook and Amazon. We live in a hypercapitalistic nightmare, though, capitalism is a bit of a misnomer, at this point. We need to decentralize and bring back a strong 4th amendment because data is the new oil. The consumer could have so much power, but we are beholden to our entrusted data overlords. "},{"text":"Some other interesting beliefs of mine lies in my love of guns & drugs! I’m a proponent of the 2nd amendment. Just one wherein we have licenses to carry (like we have licenses to drive), and take safety courses, *and okay running long here but*, require a god damn safe! *But wait! There’s more!*  We should legalize all drugs because we have a right to our bodily autonomy. "},{"text":"With these “goodies,” requires good information and strong social safety nets. With socialized healthcare we can ensure that everyone has proper access to mental healthcare and addiction-related facilities. Lastly, oft-overlooked, we should legalize prostitution – this 1 is the hardest for me (no pun intended), just because what would life be without dead hooker jokes? Yes. I have a twisted sense of humour, but I’ve always aimed for tacitness in my aim. There’s a stark difference between a witty, dark humour and just a cruel, crass low-browed joke; this proves how context is everything. One is thoughtful, the other is thoughtless. But enough about that."},{"text":"I’d like to mention how important community is to me. With all the aforementioned sex, drugs & rock ‘n roll, I just want to emphasize on 1 of the few things that holds the fun all together. We are bereft of community and spirituality in modern society and it’s a damn shame. If there’s 1 penultimate goal of mine, it is to usher in a new community, one that can breathe life, inspire, other communities. "},{"text":"I intend on writing about all the preceding passions and more. Travel and Philosophy both hold a special place in my heart, things we so desperately need to stay afloat, if not content, during these tragedies of the common.
