We live in a contentious and highly polarized society today. It’s full of hate and ignorance in spite of us living through the Age of Information. Fortunately, I do not think that the kneejerk anger and conceit will continue in perpetuity. Everyone has and will always want the same thing. To leave a legacy and love their family in peace. Every time you get caught up in vitriol and cultish worship of your “team,” you’re forgetting this. You’re letting “them” win. It’s the 1 platitude of Communism’s many that I wholly prescribe to – the working class is pitted against itself to distract workers from the rich accumulating obscene, inequitable amounts of wealth. The oligarchic, kleptocratic corporatocracy is the proper “them.”

While we argue, attack and kill one another for whatever new issue enters the news cycle, the rich getting richer is the only constant. I’m not interested in these social and racial traps that the rats have set for us. Instead, I’m interested in the progress we are making in science & technology and the implications to our health, well-being and future. What will we do when AI has replaced many of our jobs? What happens when a majority of cancer has been eradicated? What significance will art & music continue to hold when AI is capable of mimicking every minute detail? We’re passionate about the existential issues that face our society. 

So this website and its articles are dedicated to exploring these issues and, maybe, helping a few people out along the way. It’s Consumer Reports and New York Times meets Autism. We’re here to give you the lowdown on new things you’ll wish you’d have known of sooner and information on what you didn’t know you were in need of. 

I used cryptic “themes” to categorize articles, so, without further ado:
 - Awareness – Science & Technology
 - Control – Health, Fitness & Supplements
 - Escape – Travel
 - Soul – Philosophy, Self-Help
 - Present – Current Events
